                    <p>Any item inspired by the military has a <mark>functional use.</mark> Wrist watches included.
                        <br> Wrist watches were first used in the 19th century by the military to synchronize maneuvers during war. Since then, specialized watches have been used in the depths of the ocean by divers and high up in the sky by aviators.
                        <br> One of the big advantages of a watch – especially over a smartphone – is how long it can operate in the field. Many watches are made to either be self powered through motion or use a small amount of energy from a battery.
                        Think years of maintenance free time telling…..compare that to a smart phone's 8 hours!<br> A complicated watch is designed with features beyond <mark>the basic function of displaying the time and date.</mark> Such a functionality
                        is called a complication. Two of the popular complications are the chronograph, which allows the watch to function as a stopwatch and the moonphase complication, which displays the lunar phase.</p>

                    <p>Compliments.
                        <br> The range of acceptable jewelry for a man is limited. Many men are only going to be seen with three main accessories decorating their hands – a nice watch, a stylish pair of cuff links, and a simple wedding band if they're
                        married.
                        <br> In addition to helping wearers stick to their schedules, wristwatches make it easier for them to display their sense of style. They are a form of self-expression – reflecting a hint of danger, adventure and sports depending
                        on the make of the watch. Watches can communicate a lot about the wearer’s personality. For those that prefer a bit of high-status bling on their wrist, a Rolex can be an understated, timeless and incredibly masculine accessory.
                        <br> As the saying goes – boys look at their smartphones to check time – men look at a watch.
                        <br> Call it what you will, a quality luxury watch is a man's equivalent to the engagement ring.</p>

                    <p>Not only is a timepiece the quintessential gift – it is the quintessential heirloom. No matter what your philosophy is on the end of life, we can all agree that people can live on through the memories of those that knew them.
                        <br> Owning timepieces from a different era is a remembrance of people who lived before you. Having their watches makes you think of them, in a real way. They wore these same watches which show signs of use, care and love.
                        <br> A watch collection is also a legacy. It doesn't necessarily have to be worth a mini treasure – but leaving your watch(es) to someone you care about is in essence passing on values that were important to you, to someone else.</p>

                    <p>Since the days of the sundial (and probably before) – men have been obsessed with devices that measure time. A reminder that our time is limited.

                        <mark>Wearing a watch has a positive effect on my attitude towards time.</mark> I am more attentive to how I spend my 24 hours.
                        <br> Beyond the technical and mechanical intricacies of a watch – men are fascinated by these devices that claim to mark and control time.
                        <br> There is a passionate community of watch lovers who dive into the details of watch-making and collecting.
                        <br> The only other obsession matched with the passion for this inanimate object is the passion men share for cars. A watch collection is far easier to maintain and less expensive as a hobby.
                        <br> Everyone can rock a watch. Wearing a watch is a great way to add interest to an outfit, especially if you’re a guy.
                        <br> Find a wrist watch that really stands out from the rest.
                        <br> It could be the beginning of a long friendship.</p>
